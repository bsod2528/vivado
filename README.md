# vivado

- Everything done related to VLSI would be here. Mostly learning stuff, nothing like an actual project would be done here, so yeah.
- All files must be stored in `C:\vivado\..`.
- This can be done via open-source tools (which I've installed but clearly lazy to use.), but I've done this via Vivado.

# Setup
Well if you really wanna try this out go ahead.

- Install AMD Vivado
- Clone this repo.
- Create a project called cpu or whatever in Vivado.
- Use the [`design sources`](design%20sources/) for creating RTL Design modules && (haha) [`testbenches`](testbenches/) for...testbenches.
- Simulate | (again...haha) synthesize your wish.
