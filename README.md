# vivado

- Everything done related to VLSI would be here. Mostly learning stuff, nothing like an actual project would be done here, so yeah.
- All files must be stored in `C:\vivado\..`.
- This can be done via open-source tools (which I've installed but clearly lazy to use.), but I've done this via Vivado.
